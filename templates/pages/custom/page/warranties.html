            <p>Treasure Garden products being used in residential use and applications only are guaranteed to be free from defects in original material and workmanship. Treasure Garden items are designed for residential use and are not warranted for commercial applications (unless specified for Commercial use).</p>

If a defect in the original material or workmanship appears during the warranty period on any Treasure Garden product; Treasure Garden, at its option, will repair or replace the product without charge.</p>
            <p>Wind damage is not covered under the Limited Warranty.</p>
            <p><strong>Fabric Limited Warranty:</strong><br>The following fabric lines have a limited warranty against fading for:<br>5 years - Sunbrella/Outdura/Sunbury/Bella-Dura/Docril<br>4 years - O'bravia<br>2 years - Solefin</p>
            <p><strong>What Is NOT Covered:</strong><br>Failure caused by unreasonable or abusive use, or failure caused by neglect of reasonable and necessary care are not covered by this warranty. Additionally, acts of nature (including but not limited to wind, hurricanes, tornadoes, and storms) are not covered by this warranty. This warranty covers return freight of any warranted product only for the first year. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may have other rights which vary from state to state.</p>
            <p><strong>Wind Damage:</strong><br>Treasure Garden highly recommends that no umbrella, regardless of size or weight, ever be left unattended in the open position. In windy conditions, it is further recommended that umbrellas be closed, removed from their base, and stored, or laid horizontally. This will reduce the risk of damage to your umbrella, furniture, and other belongings or property. To ensure stability of your umbrella, please observe proper placement, and use sufficient weight (base). The Treasure Garden catalog contains minimum recommendations for necessary weight; but this can vary, depending on the conditions in your particular area.</p>
            <p><strong>Rust:</strong><br>Rust is a natural part of the aging process of all Steel or Iron based materials and is therefore NOT considered a defect. Treasure Garden Cast Iron &amp; Steel plate bases are designed to require minimum maintenance. Bases should be kept clean. Do not let dirt build up on the bases. Cleaning with mild soap and water, and seasonal touch-up of any scratches, chips or occasional rust see page from crevices or hidden, un-finishable surfaces inherent in some designs is all that is required. Touch Up paint in matching frame colors are available. Never leave bases standing in water. To keep your bases looking their best, you may wish to store them when not in use for an extended period of time.</p>

            <h2><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>WARRANTY TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</strong></span></h2>
            <p><strong>Forces of Nature</strong></p>
            <p>Although all TUUCI marine-grade shade equipment is rigorously tested to withstand incredible forces of nature, TUUCI does not recommend or warranty the deployment or use of any collapsible shade equipment in wind conditions which exceed 25 MPH (45 MPH for the MAX F-1; TUUCI Equinox depending on configuration may exceed 100 mph).</p>
            <p>TUUCI will only warranty products which are properly secured to an adequate base or anchoring system. Furthermore, TUUCI will not cover any damage to a shade or base device which occurs as a result of contact with the ground or any other foreign object including damage which occurs as a result of sudden and severe weather events or other extreme acts of nature. In general, TUUCI recommends that all collapsible shade products be securely closed when not in use.</p>
            <p>TUUCI can recommend specific base weight and anchoring systems for specific parasol styles, shapes and sizes, however, TUUCI will only warrant the safe, sensible and reasonable operation of our shade structures within the recommended deployment guidelines. Please contact TUUCI directly if requesting shade devices and anchoring systems which can be warranted in sustained wind conditions which exceed 25 MPH.</p>
            <p><strong>Fabrics and Finishes</strong></p>
            <p>TUUCI passes to its customers the identical fabric warranties granted by the various manufacturers, which protect against the fabric losing its color or strength from extreme exposure conditions, including UV degradation and mildew. Users must properly maintain (including clean regularly) fabrics for the warranty to be effective. These warranties do not cover damage from contact with foreign objects, misuse or abuse (rips, burns, tears and holes).<br>With intensive usage of the products in a hostile environment (seaside and indoor pool use), we advise that you regularly rinse the fabric of the umbrella using fresh water in order to prevent the build-up of salt and chloride residues.</p>
            <p>If any fabric (SUNBRELLA® or other TUUCI Tuff Skin) fabric is rendered unserviceable by loss of color or strength caused by UV degradation, mildew, rot or atmospheric chemicals, TUUCI will replace or repair the fabric at its discretion. Labor charges will apply to the cutting and sewing of any fabric replaced under warranty.</p>
            <p>If TUUCI applied powder coating or Aluma-TEAK™ finish to frames, structures or shade anchor flakes, bubbles, peels, or loses color within five (5) years from the date of purchase, TUUCI will replace or repair any paint finish damage at its own discretion. This warranty does not cover any type of scratches or abrasions to finish caused from metal to metal contact (ex. From table tops or storage) or any resulting corrosion that results from scratches or abrasions.</p>
            <p>Seaside and indoor pool use, salt and chlorides can accumulate on the powder coat and Aluma-TEAK™ finishes, leading to finish failure outside warranty coverage. Failure to perform regular cleanings with fresh water may cause the finish to blister, oxidize and/or discolor, voiding this limited warranty.</p>
            <p><strong>Shade Anchors</strong></p>
            <p>Warranty only covers manufacturing defects of structural integrity. It does not cover breakage, chipping, crumbling concrete or finish abrasions due to contact with other objects, improper use or issues caused by “onsite” transit or other wear and tear.</p>
            <p><strong>Electrical Components</strong></p>
            <p>Optional LED lighting, heaters and automation electrical components are warranted for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase against manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship to the original purchaser of the product. This warranty does not apply to damage resulting from accident, misuse, tampering, negligence or abuse. TUUCI will, at its option, repair or replace these products found defective.</p>
            <p><strong>Process for Warranty Claims to Structure</strong></p>
            <p>If warrantable damage occurs to the hubs, mast or stainless-steel hardware, TUUCI will replace or repair any item listed in this category at its discretion. Superficial damage, including any type of scratches or abrasions caused from contact with the moving components of the frame itself or canopy during normal operation are not eligible for warranty coverage unless the damage compromises the structural integrity of the frame. For the warranty to apply, products must be properly cared for and maintained. Any product modification by customer or third party voids this warranty.</p>
            <p><strong>General Limitations</strong></p>
            <p>The limited warranties outlined above cover only manufacturer defects, not damage caused by the product striking the ground or other object. Normal wear and tear is not covered under this limited warranty. The redeemable value of all warranties provided herewith shall be prorated over the life of the specific limited warranty itself. In all cases, the warranty claimant shall be responsible for all shipping and/or freight charges incurred by claimant or TUUCI as a result of a warranty claim. Labor for installation of parts covered under TUUCI Warranty is not included.</p>
            <p>All warranty claims must be submitted with an original proof of purchase dated from the dealer of origin, a description of damaged product, including how the damage occurred, along with photos of the damaged product. The foregoing warranties may not be assigned and are available only to the original purchaser of TUUCI products. TUUCI reserves at its sole discretion the right to repair, replace, or redesign any product that is returned as a result of a warranty claim.</p>
