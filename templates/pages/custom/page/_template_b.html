                            White Glove Delivery by AuthenTEAK is an elevated level of delivery service that includes the delivery by scheduled appointment, product assembly, product set-up/placement and carton/packaging removal.

                            Selecting White Glove Delivery may add an additional 1 - 2 weeks to our standard delivery times as we first ship to a receiving/delivery company in your local area and they in turn will add you to their schedule for the last mile White Glove Delivery. The local service provider will carefully unpack, inspect and assemble each item, place the item(s) where you want, and take all the packaging with them when they leave. This service is recommended for furniture, cantilevers, and single table purchases, or if you require the product to be brought to a specific location. This service does not include installation or connection to gas lines, installation of cantilever mount kits, or sand for cantilever bases. This service also does not include the hookup or connection of any electrical or component wires.

                            When your order arrives at the local service center, you will be contacted by a scheduling clerk for an appointment. The appointment is typically a 4-hour window, Monday - Friday during regular business hours. Saturday or Sunday deliveries are not available.

                        <p class="landing__p l">
                            We ask that you have the area in which the product is being delivered clear of debris and obstacles, including the walkway into the space. Please make sure doorways are of sufficient height and width in relation to the items going through. If you live in a condo or apartment, you may need to arrange elevator appointment for your delivery. This may include installation of floor and wall pads. Please ask your building manager to provide you with the interior dimensions (to include doorway) of the elevator to insure product fit. For cantilever umbrellas that use a sand filled base, you should have the sand available prior to the delivery.
                        </p>

                            For all White Glove Deliveries, you MUST inspect the product and any packaging you see at the time of delivery. If there is any damage to either the product or the package, or if there is any reason for you to be at all concerned about damage, please reference it clearly on the PROOF OF DELIVERY sheet that they ask you to sign. This simply insures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the problem.

                            First Threshold Delivery is an enhanced delivery option that ensures your order is delivered to the outermost door of the delivery address, in most cases being the front door, garage, or service entrance of a multi-family property. The difference between Standard Delivery and First Threshold Delivery is that the standard option is a delivery to the beginning of your driveway (i.e. curbside). First Threshold Delivery helps provide assurance and peace of mind with your order, bringing your delivery safely to your doorstep and away from the street. Due to occasional carrier restrictions and/or potential distance limitations, First Threshold Delivery may not be available and in those cases, we reserve the right to cancel this service with sufficient notice and refund any applicable fees.

                            You are responsible for inspecting merchandise at time of delivery while the delivery agent is present. All carton surfaces must be inspected for signs of damage; those sitting directly on the pallet are most prone to forklift damage.
                        </p>
                        <p class="landing__p l">
                            If a carton is crushed or has any punctures, tears, indentations, or creases, then you should open it to inspect the contents for damage. Even if you do not find any obvious damage, please write "Damaged Carton" on the receipt when signing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="landing__p l">
                            Shipping pallets and shrink wrap should be in good condition and intact. If a pallet is broken, you should open any cartons sitting directly on the pallet and inspect the contents. Shrink wrap that is punctured, torn, or missing is a common indicator of damage. You should also note this on the receipt, even if there is no obvious damage. If a carton containing wicker furniture is crushed or dented, verify that the frame is not bent by placing the item on a level surface (e.g., place a chair on a level surface such as a table top and make sure all legs touch the surface).

                            Once you have signed for the items as damaged, please contact us either by phone at 833-257-7070, or via email at customercare@authenteak.com to report the damage so that we may begin to get you the replacements that you need in a timely manner. We will most likely ask that you submit some pictures of the damage as well, as this will help us in our claim process with the carrier.

                            In some cases, we may ask that you hold onto the damaged items until such time that the carrier can inspect or pick them up in order to settle our claim. Please do not discard the damaged items without speaking to someone from AuthenTEAK first.
